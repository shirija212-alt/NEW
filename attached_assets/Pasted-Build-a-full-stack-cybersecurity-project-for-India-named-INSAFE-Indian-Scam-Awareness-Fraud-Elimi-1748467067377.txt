Build a full-stack cybersecurity project for India named INSAFE (Indian Scam Awareness & Fraud Elimination) that detects and prevents online money scams (like loan, rummy, phishing), using AI/ML.

Requirements:

🔧 Backend:

Use FastAPI.

Create APIs for:

/scan/url: Detect scam URLs using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression.

/scan/qr: Accept QR image, decode and scan its URL.

/scan/apk: Accept APK file, extract strings, detect scam patterns (loan/rummy).

/scan/sms: Accept text and detect scam SMS using NLP.

/scan/call: Accept call transcript and detect scam attempt.

/report: Accept user-submitted scam app or site reports.


Save all scans & reports to MongoDB or PostgreSQL.


📊 AI Models:

URL Model: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression.

SMS/Call Text Classifier: Use pretrained NLP (e.g. sklearn, or bert-base-uncased fine-tuned if possible).

APK Analysis: Match strings against a keyword database (loan, rummy, earn, UPI, etc.).


🌐 Frontend:

Use React + TailwindCSS.

Pages: Home, Scan URL, Scan QR, Scan APK, Scan SMS, Scan Call, Report Scam.

Components:

Navbar

ResultCard (verdict, confidence)

UploadForms for QR and APK

Text form for SMS and Call



🗂 Folder Structure:

backend/ (FastAPI code, ML models, preprocessing)

frontend/ (React components and pages)

ml_models/ (Saved models, vectorizers)

dataset/ (CSV datasets for URL and SMS training)


📦 Features:

Real-time verdicts.

Accepts user reports for unknown scams.

Logs every scan in DB.

Dockerfile for deployment.

Sample training scripts: train_url_model.py, train_sms_model.py.


📍 Indian Context:

Focus on scam patterns common in India:

“Instant loan”, “rummy cash win”, “KBC prize”, “SBI call warning”, “UPI verify”


UI in English, but easy to localize.


🧪 Test Input Samples:

URL: https://loanapproval.online

SMS: "Congrats! You've won 25 lakh rupees in KBC lottery. Click now."

Call transcript: "Sir, I’m calling from RBI. Share your OTP for verification."

QR code: Should decode to a scammy loan/phishing link

APK: FakeRummy.apk with scam keywords inside


🔄 Bonus (Optional):

Add Telegram bot for scanning

Admin dashboard to view flagged scams
